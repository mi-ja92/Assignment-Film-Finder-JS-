Requirements
Your project should satisfy the following:

As a user, I want to see the available movies as posters from the movie.
Check the data: There is a link to the poster for each movie in the database.
As a user, I want to filter out the movies with 5 filters in a form of radio buttons. The filter functions will be described as follows.
As a user, I can only filter one at a time.
The current filter will switch to the filter that has been clicked on(radio button). Unless it's a checkbox then there can be more filters selected at the same time.
Category 1: As a user, I want to filter all new movies: from the last years, this means 2014 and newer.
Category 2: As a user, I want to filter movies with "Avenger" in the title.
Category 3: As a user, I want to filter movies with "X-Men" in the title.
Category 4: As a user, I want to filter movies with "Princess" in the title.
Category 5: As a user, I want to filter movies with "Batman" in the title.
Use array methods for the filters.
check if a string is already in another string with .includes()` method.
The last 4 filters look very alike, Do you need multiple functions for that? Or can it be solved with one function?
As a user, I can click on a poster from the movie, which will link me to their IMDB page.
